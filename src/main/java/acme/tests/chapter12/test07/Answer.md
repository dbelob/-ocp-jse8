B. The code compiles without issue, so Option D is incorrect. The first print() statement
refers to value in the Deeper class, so 5 is printed. The second and third print() statements
actually refer to the same value in the Deep class, so 2 is printed twice. The prefix
Matrix. is unnecessary in the first of the two print() statements and does not change the
result. For these reasons, Option B is the correct answer.
